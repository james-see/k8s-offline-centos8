# k8s-offline-centos8
This gets you running with docker and kubernetes with centos 8 completely offline mode.

## concept

1. Get everything you need ready for an offline install by going online first
2. Deploy the offline installation by simply cloning this repo and running the code

## why

Offline is still useful and will always be. When you are in situations with no internet connection, you can run this gatherer and store it on a thumbdrive and then run the deployer on any system without internet access.

### requirements

Centos 8 VM (I am using Parallels) or system with Centos 8 installed

### q&a

Will this work with x version of Centos?

I have no clue, haven't had time to test.

Will this work with Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.?

Probably not. I will make those in the future hopefully. Again, time.
